# My Data Engineering Practice

This repo contains my solutions to exercises from data-engineering-practice (https://github.com/danielbeach/data-engineering-practice/tree/main).

The original exercises were created by danielbeach, and I’ve used the structure and data files as scaffolding.

All solution code is my own.
